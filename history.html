                    <p>
                        While Tyler's career up to this point has been incredibly diverse, and at points extremely controversial, he 
                        has done several rebrandings over the years, with the release fo IGOR being the most recent case of this phenomenon. 
                        This can make it quite difficult to follow what he has done over the years and more importantly why he did them.
                        This page is meant to help remedy the problem by providing a central source of information on his artistic history.

                    <h2>EARLY DAYS (2007-2011)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Before he went almost exclusively solo, Tyler founded and was a major part of the Hip-Hop collective Odd Future founded 
                        by him, and some friends and fellow musicians out of LA in 2007. They released their first mix tape titled <i>"The Odd Future Tape"</i>
                        shortly after in 2008, which would be far from the last project they would work on together throughout the following years. In 2009
                        Tyler established a foothold for himself and by extension the rest of Odd Future with the release of <i>BASTARD</i>. Being an 
                        incredibly controversial project, consisting of a dark contemplation on many aspects of modern life we prefer not to think about:
                        suicide, discrimination, sexual violence. The taboo nature of these subjects polarized many people to him and much of the work
                        he would release over the next few years. Controversy begets popularity however, and contributed to the mix tape's massive 
                        commercial success given the relative obscurity of Odd Future and Tyler at the time, and in many ways was responsible for putting 
                        them on the map. The methodical and atmospheric quality of the mix tape resonated with many who weren't turned off by the intentionally
                        shocking subject matter, creating a loyal fan base that would only grow over time. Tyler's next release, <i>GOBLIN</i>, would in many ways
                        follow in the same footsteps of <i>BASTARD</i>, continuing with the same tone and narrative structure, with each track being framed as a 
                        conversation with his therapist. The debut album, and more specifically the hit single <i>YONKERS</i>, 
                        would bring a level of success unparalleled in scale. It was a breakout hit, with the track peaking at number two on Billboard's 
                        top one hundred. This would lead into Odd Future's peak in cultural relevance, due to countless collaborations between members while
                        each member offering enough on an individual level without overtaking each other in the spotlight.

                    <h2>WOLF (2012-2014)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Riding off of the success of Goblin, the next two years were more focused on group collaborations, like the Adult Swim show <i>"Loiter Squad"</i>
                        , the only studio album they would release as a group entitled <i>"The OF Tape Vol. 2"</i>, and touring together for these and other projects.
                        Over this time, many of the members released solo material, and they were mostly able to do the without getting n each other's way. However, when 
                        Tyler dropped hs next studio album in 2014, <i>WOLF</i>, the group started to have more and more division. It wasn't quite the hit <i>GOBLIN</i> in terms 
                        of commercial success, but received more critical success compared to his first two solo projects for its more refined sound, numerous features, and 
                        further exploration of the themes seen on the previous records. And after the unifying force of making and promoting this album started to fade away 
                        following its release, the cracks started to show in Odd Future. Members started to leave and form their own splinter groups. Relationships started to 
                        become strained even between core members. Many felt that Tyler had gotten too much of the limelight, and he felt they hadn't appreciated the success
                        he had brought them by association. By 2015, the group went silent, and all went off on their own separate paths. It would be in this environment that 
                        Tyler would release his most panned project to date.
