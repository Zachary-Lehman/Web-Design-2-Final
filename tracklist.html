                    <p>
                        The album has a thunderous start with IGOR'S THEME, which excellently serves to establish the sound and narrative for the 
                        remainder of the project. It starts with a deep, grimy thirty-second long synth note, serving to disorient and surprise the 
                        listener and demands their attention. Then the drum groove hits, and completely changes the tone of the track, making things 
                        much more upbeat. Glistening pads, soft vocals, and glossy pianos coming in subtly gives the listening experience an optimistic, 
                        almost dreamlike quality. It also serves to introduce the narrative to the listener, not by explicitly stating specific events
                        or characters, but by repeating fractured phrases that reveal their true meaning in later tracks as we will soon see.

                    <p>
                        Things shift into a more pop-soul direction on EARFQUAKE, the headlining single from the album. Sonically the track is even brighter
                        than the previous, with more focus placed on the earnest vocals and flashy piano runs. The intro and first chorus sound a little bit 
                        awkward due to the singing from Tyler sounding straight out of a cheesy 80's soul ballad, however as the song progresses deep synth pads
                        and more confident vocals reveal a new dimension to the track, once again subverting the listener's expectations. This is also where the 
                        narrative begins to make a much clearer shape. On this track, Tyler is pleading with his love interest, trying to keep them from leaving.
                        Frequently saying <i>"Don't leave, its my fault"</i>, this relationship is already in a bad spot. It's not exactly clear yet what exactly 
                        is causing this conflict, which motivates the listener to pay attention to find out. The lyric 
                        <i>"<b>Riding around</b>, you tell me something, baby, and it's making my heart break"</i> is referencing back to the line in IGOR'S theme
                        <i>"Ridin' round town, they gon' feel this one"</i>, which will continue to be a common motif throughout the rest of the album, and acting 
                        to connect the tracks intricately together into a cohesive whole.

                    <p>
                        The punchy, spacey sound of I THINK is Tyler fully embracing his feelings for this other person, put not knowing how to manage it.
                        The the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkRdgFvuiYk&ab_channel=Tyler%2CTheCreator" class="inlink">music video</a> is helpful here, showing Tyler and his love interest at a crowded, chaotic party, which perfectly matching his 
                        emotions. The sound of the song is defined by the beating drum groove and blocky synths that help to serve this narrative. <i>"I think I've fallen in love"</i>
                        is the main focus of the chorus, which excellently sharpens the focus onto the basic message for this more poppy, lively track.

                    <p>
                        This track, while mildly being important to the overall narrative, is extremely short and there is not much to talk about regarding it. It is simply a dreamy transition between two tracks and serves that job well enough.
                        Narratively the line <i>"Giving it everything that you can, there's always an obstacle"</i> leads well into the main obstacle in RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

                    <p>
                        RUNNING OUT OF TIME is the soft, calming piece before the raging storm. Elaborate arpeggios, swirling pads, and a slow, steady rhythm,
                        gives it a sense of day-dreaming, apathetic bliss. There is a sense of urgency, Tyler is trying to prevent the relationship falling apart,
                        but its still not quite clear what the problem is. Energy wise it is the lowest point on the album, while also being fairly short, falling 
                        just short of the three minute mark. Despite the somewhat negative connotation of the track title and some of the lyrics, there are enough bright 
                        elements to give the track an overall melancholy tone. <i>"Take your mask off"</i> is a plea to his partner to stop putting on a charade, so they
                        can work through their problems before they become overwhelming, but at this point they are still trying to make things work. The next track will
                        throw this completely out the window.

                    <p>
                        NEW MAGIC WAND is arguably the most important song on the album for narrative, thematic, and structural reasons. The track begins with another cryptic 
                        statement with "Sometimes you have to close a door to open a door", which then directly goes into the disorienting beat. Using sparse metallic percussion, 
                        a thick distorted synth bass and understated vocals create a major sense of unease in the listener. As the song progresses, unlike many of the tracks before 
                        this, ambiguity is largely removed. This is when Tyler reaches his breaking point, and gives his love interest an ultimatum. They have been spending a lot of
                        time with someone else besides him, driving him crazy with jealousy. His envy completely overwhelms him, shown when he says <i>"This 60-40 (Isn't) workin'
                        I want a hundred of your time, you're mine"</i>. No one else can be in the picture whatsoever. They have to be only dedicated to him. Sonically the track transitions from a very stripped back, chilling
                        sound into a more relaxing, soothing section for the bridge before finally exploding into the pure embodiment of chaos at the climax, resolving into a haunting
                        synth note. The track builds up to this point through the subtle use of elements being quietly introduced overtime to both add depth to the mix and to improve repeat 
                        listens.

                    <p>
                        A BOY IS A GUN* is a much more laid-back song in comparison to the track preceding it, despite this however it excellently serves as a pivot point for the record as 
                        a whole, with an overall more melancholy, soulful sound to flesh out the concepts previously introduced. The track serves to reveal the true extent of the corrupted relationship.
                        While on NEW MAGIC WAND it wasn't clear if Tyler's reaction was due to overreaction or not, now with a clearer view the truth is made much closer with a moment of relative calm.
                        Tyler's love interest is not able to commit. They can't between choose him or the other person they're seeing. And it scares Tyler. One of the most repeated phrases throughout the 
                        track is <i>"Please don't shoot me down"</i>. He doesn't want to be the one put on the outside. He exemplifies this by constantly shifting from a position of demanding they 
                        make up their mind, to pleading for them to stay. This shows just how unstable the relationship really is, and only leaves the question of what will happen next.

                    <p>
                        PUPPET is all about manipulation. This is the point where Tyler really starts to realize the massive problems with the relationship, and that he essentially completely at the will
                        of this person. The track's slow, trodding pace really hammers home the degree they have gotten to. There is now a shift away from trying to fix the relationship to actively acgknowleging 
                        the faults with it. Sonically there is much more of a focus on melancholy soul instrumentation, with strings, subtle synths, and feeble vocals to further emphasize the feeling of oppourtunity 
                        slipping away.

                    <p>
                        WHAT'S GOOD is easily the most hip-hop influenced track on the entire album, with hard hitting bass and percussion, accompanied by a fast and hard flow by Tyler, creating an uneasy vibe. 
                        At this point, Tyler has had enough. He has come to his senses. He has fully realized the relationship won't work no matter what he does. So he decides to stop trying. He confronts his 
                        love interest, IGOR, one final time saying that, finally, <i>"I see the light"</i>.

                        GONE, GONE / THANK YOU has a very somber, yet simultaneously happy tone to them. It is a thankful goodbye, cloaked in denial. Tyler is attempting to bury his feelings, and pretend that he is thankful
                        for the place the relationship has reached.

                    <p>
                        I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE is a pleading track, with Tyler attempting to convince himself that his feelings are behind him. Very minimalistic at first, but quickly blossoms into a dripping vocal rich 
                        performance that is sure to surprise you in the bets way possible.

                    <p>
                        ARE WE STILL FREINDS is the triumphant finale to finish off the album. Tyler is decides to still try and cling on by trying to stay as friends. Even if he part of him knows it will never happen.
                        He still feels like he has to try. The instrumental is extremely dramatic and almost theatrical, with a full soul band of strings and synths backing Tyler's incredibly emotional vocal performance
                        to round out the track list and finish the album.
